# Wasuchok

Hi there—I'm Wasuchok, a caffeine-fueled developer who enjoys designing calm experiences even when the backend is chaos.

## About
- Build, break, learn, repeat.
- Believe every bug has a lesson (and usually a sequel).
- When the laptop closes, I recover with deep sleep and tech rabbit holes.

## Focus
- Fast, reliable web services.
- Friendly developer tooling and automation.
- Clean design with less noise.

## Toolbox
`TypeScript` `Go` `Dart` `Python` `Node.js` `React` `Flutter` `FastAPI` `PostgreSQL` `Docker`
